# Domain-Tracker
Domain tracker Chrome extension


- The Chrome extension records every webpage you visits and catalogs all the links on those pages. It can also track links detected from dynamically updated content, like newly loaded tweets or posts on platforms such as Twitter or Reddit.
- The recorded data is stored locally (you own your data!). In the extension's popup, you can view stats, like the total number of visited sites and links, with a "Show More Details" button. Clicking this button opens a new tab, presenting comprehensive information in a table format on a separate page.
